# php-mysql-prepared-statements-class

## Inrtroduction

	- This is a php class which can be used for simple database queries using prepared statements, Its under development yet and not a final version.
	- Most of the programmers use the mysql with prepared statements, while I was doing the same, but it was being really time consuming for me to everytime write a long code to perform a simple dataase query, it inspired me to work on this class file or a mini project which now I can use in any of my project to simplify my work.
	- Suggest what more I can do for improvement and how can I make it more proper...
	- Also looking for a help to convert it into PDO..

## Documentation

	- I will upload all the documentation in the wiki section as time permits.

## Examples

	- I am working on the examples and will upload them as time permits.
	- In all the examples in this folder I have used the world database provided by oracle in mysql sample databases.
	- It is available to download as world.sql in examples folder.
	- Those examples will help you to understand more about the class.
